    "### Measures of central tendency : \n",
    "#### 1) Mean:\n",
    "##### Outliers can significantly impact the mean because the mean is sensitive to extreme values.\n",
    "##### An outlier that is much higher or lower than the other data points can pull the mean in its direction.\n",
    "##### Example: Consider the dataset [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 200]. The mean is greatly influenced by the outlier (200), resulting in a higher mean.\n",
    "#### 2) Median:\n",
    "##### The median is less affected by outliers because it is not influenced by the actual values but rather their order.\n",
    "##### An outlier does not have as much impact on the median as it does on the mean.\n",
    "##### Example: Using the same dataset [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 200], the median remains relatively unchanged because it is not affected by the value of the outlier.\n",
    "#### 3) Mode:\n",
    "##### Outliers generally do not affect the mode, as the mode is determined by the most frequently occurring value.\n",
    "##### If there is no repeated value, or all values occur with the same frequency, the dataset is considered to have no mode.\n",
    "##### Example: In the dataset [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 200], there is no mode.\n",
    "### Measures of Dispersion:\n",
    "#### 1) Range:\n",
    "##### Outliers can significantly impact the range, as it is the difference between the maximum and minimum values.\n",
    "##### A single outlier can lead to a much larger range.\n",
    "##### Example: In the dataset [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 200], the range is heavily influenced by the outlier (200).\n",
    "#### 2) Variance and Standard Deviation:\n",
    "##### Outliers can have a substantial impact on variance and standard deviation because they involve squared differences from the mean.\n",
    "##### Squaring the difference accentuates the effect of outliers on these measures.\n",
    "##### Example: Using the dataset [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 200], the variance and standard deviation are greatly influenced by the outlier.\n",
    "#### 3) Interquartile Range (IQR):\n",
    "##### IQR is less sensitive to outliers because it involves the range of the middle 50% of the data.\n",
    "##### It is less affected by extreme values in the tails of the distribution.\n",
    "##### Example: In the dataset [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 200], the IQR is less affected by the outlier."
